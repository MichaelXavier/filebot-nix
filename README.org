   - java of some sort
     nativeBuildInputs? i think so
     but that's for build and runtime? probably not worth fretting about
   - javafx/openjfx?
   reference https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/filebot/
   - how to do data dir?
     patch the shit out of the filebot script?
     theirs is much simpler
     https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/filebot-arch.sh?h=filebot

   pkgs needed:
   - javafx still needed?
     java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javafx/embed/swing/JFXPanel

   maybe use this?
